Diabetes Prediction Model using SVM

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical attributes.
The model is built using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.

Machine Learning Algorithm:

Algorithm Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Kernel: Linear
Feature Scaling: StandardScaler
Train-Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing

Exploratory Data Analysis
Statistical summary using describe()
Class distribution using value_counts()
Correlation matrix and heatmap to analyze relationships between features and the target variable
